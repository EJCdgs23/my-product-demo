            <h3>Seafood Salad</h3>
            <p>Our Seafood salad is a combination of crab meat, celery, red onion and dill, all tossed in a dressing that's made with mayonnaise and Old Bay seasoning. While mayo and seafood might sound like an odd pairing, it's actually a lot like a classic tuna salad.</p>

             <h3>Makizushi</h3>
            <p>Makizushi, also known as “norimaki,” refers to a type of sushi where rice and ingredients are carefully rolled in a sheet of nori seaweed, which is then cut into smaller pieces. It’s believed that makizushi came into existence in the early 1700s, soon after sheet nori was invented with a similar technique used for paper making. The name norimaki is made up of two Japanese words: “Maki” meaning to roll and “nori” referring to the toasted sheet of nori seaweed used to wrap the ingredients.</p>

             <h3>Goan Crab Curry</h3>

    <h4>About US</h4>
    <p>Our Sushi & Seafood Resto's attempts to use local, sustainable, and organic ingredients wherever feasible. We work hard to find high-quality ingredients and prepare everything from scratch with care.<br>We also make every effort to give our employees a livable salary (tips are distributed to all employees, including kitchen staff) and to minimise our environmental impact whenever possible. Overall, these issues result in increased menu pricing, but we hope you discover value and find comfort in knowing that we strive to do better every day at what is essential to us.</p>
