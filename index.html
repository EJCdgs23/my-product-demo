            <h3>Seafood Salad</h3>
            <p>Our Seafood salad is a combination of crab meat, celery, red onion and dill, all tossed in a dressing that's made with mayonnaise and Old Bay seasoning. While mayo and seafood might sound like an odd pairing, it's actually a lot like a classic tuna salad.</p>

            <h3>Makizushi</h3>
            <p>Makizushi, also known as “norimaki,” refers to a type of sushi where rice and ingredients are carefully rolled in a sheet of nori seaweed, which is then cut into smaller pieces. It’s believed that makizushi came into existence in the early 1700s, soon after sheet nori was invented with a  similar technique used for paper making. The name norimaki is made up of two Japanese words: “Maki” meaning to roll and “nori” referring to the toasted sheet of nori seaweed used to wrap the ingredients.</p>

                <p>From check in to check out, the staff is fantastic. At check in they gave us great information on local restaurants and things happening at the resort for the week. The in house restaurant staff is very accommodating and nice. A breath of fresh air to most places we have been. The outside pool service is great for food and drinks. We used this almost everyday for lunch. The beach at this resort is fantastic as well. At low tide you can see all sorts of things from starfish, crabs, shells, sand dollars, etc. We even found three horseshoe crabs in the tide pools at low tide. We will definitely vacation here again.</p>

                <p>A very friendly welcoming place to spend a couple of nights.  All personnel were very well trained, accommodating and helpful (all done with a smile).  Everything was handled with efficiency and attention to every detail was given.  Food was delicious and the view was wonderful while dining. Thanks for doing such an outstanding job to make the stay so pleasurable.</p>

    <h4>About US.</h4>
    <p>Our Sushi & Seafood Resto's attempts to use local, sustainable, and organic ingredients wherever feasible. We work hard to find high-quality ingredients and prepare everything from scratch with care.<br>We also make every effort to give our employees a livable salary (tips are distributed to all employees, including kitchen staff) and to minimise our environmental impact whenever possible. Overall, these issues result in increased menu pricing, but we hope you discover value and find comfort in knowing that we strive to do better every day at what is essential to us.</p>
